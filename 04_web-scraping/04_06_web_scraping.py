# Look for a static website online that has some information that you're
# interested in. Follow the web-scraping steps described in the course to
# inspect, scrape, and parse the information.
# BE RESPECTFUL! Don't scrape sites that don't want to be scraped, and
# limit the amount of calls you make to their page by saving the response
# to a file, and parsing the content from that file.
